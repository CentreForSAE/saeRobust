In this vignette you find some notes on how to assess the numerical stability of
algorithms.

## Test Data

The package provides some utility functions to construct test data on which the
numerical stability of algorithms can be tested. The general approach is to
generate data with the worst possible properties and at the same time is easily
represented in a computer (only integer values). Research in this area is
sparse. Zielke (????) is one of the few authors contributing to this subject and
the construction of constructing the test data is also motivated from a time
where storage and computation time was much more an issue than today. However,
the developed ideas are the foundation for this approach.

### What is the worst possible?

```{r}
library("Matrix")
library("magrittr")

# Test X
Z1 <- Matrix(rep(999, 4), ncol = 2)
X <- testMatX(Z1, Z1)
X
isSymmetric(X)
det(X)
solve(X)

# Test Y
y0 <- testResponse0(X)
y <- as.numeric(testResponse(y0, k = 4))
dirVar <- rep(var(as.numeric((abs(y - y0)))), length(y))

# fh <- sae::eblupFH(
#     y ~ X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X6 - 1,
#     dirVar,
#     data = data.frame(y = as.numeric(y), as.matrix(X), dirVar)
# )
# 
# fit <- fitrfh(y, X[, -1], dirVar, c(lm.fit(as.matrix(X[, -1]), y)$coefficients, 1), k = 1e6)
# sum((predict(fit)$REBLUP - y) / y)
# sum((fh$eblup - y) / y)
