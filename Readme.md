# Robust Methods for Robust Small Area Estimation

Methods to fit robust alternatives to commonly used models used in
Small Area Estimation. The methods here used are based on best linear
unbiased predictions and linear mixed models. At this time available models
are area level models incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation in
the random effects.
